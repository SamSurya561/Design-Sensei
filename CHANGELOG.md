### Added
- **Enhanced Sidebar UI/UX**: Refactored the entire sidebar into a new, dedicated `SidebarNav.tsx` component to improve code organization and maintainability.
- **Grouped Navigation**: Reorganized sidebar navigation links into logical groups ("Main Menu," "Support," and "System") with clear headings for a more intuitive user experience.
- **Search Functionality**: Added a search input field to the sidebar header for future feature implementation.

### Changed
- **Redesigned User Footer**: Completely redesigned the user profile section in the sidebar footer to match the user-provided reference image, featuring a cleaner layout with the user's avatar, name, email, and a distinct logout icon.
- **Visual Polish**: Adjusted padding, spacing, and layout throughout the sidebar to create a more balanced, modern, and aesthetically pleasing design.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-09
### Added
- **User Profile Page**: Created a new, dedicated `/profile` page for authenticated users to manage their account.
- **Profile Information Form**: Implemented a form on the profile page allowing users to update their display name and add a date of birth.
- **Account Management**: Added a section for account settings, including a "Reset Password" option for users who signed up with an email and password.
- **Reusable DatePicker Component**: Built a new DatePicker component using `shadcn/ui` primitives for selecting the date of birth.
- **Profile Page Route**: Added the `/profile` route to `App.tsx` and linked the user's avatar in the sidebar to this new page.

---

## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-08
### Added
- **Dedicated Auth Pages**: Created new, focused pages for `/login` and `/signup` to provide a conventional user authentication experience.
- **Email/Password & Google Sign-In**: Implemented forms on both auth pages for email/password authentication and buttons for Google Sign-In.
- **Conditional Layout Rendering**: Updated the main `App.tsx` layout to intelligently render either the main application with the sidebar or the focused auth pages, depending on the current route.

### Changed
- **Sidebar Auth Links**: Updated the "Log In" and "Sign Up" buttons in the sidebar to be links that navigate to the new dedicated authentication pages.
- **Refined Auth Functions**: Enhanced the `lib/auth.ts` library to include functions for email/password sign-up and to handle errors more gracefully.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-08
### Added
- **Firebase Integration**: Switched the backend service from Supabase to Firebase for authentication and database services.
- **Firebase Configuration**: Created a `firebase-config.ts` file to initialize the Firebase app using secure environment variables.
- **Global Auth Provider**: Implemented a new `AuthProvider` using React Context to manage and provide the user's authentication state across the entire application.
- **Theme Provider**: Added a `ThemeProvider` to manage the light/dark mode state and persist the user's preference in local storage.

### Changed
- **Dynamic Sidebar Footer**: The sidebar footer now dynamically displays the user's profile information and a "Log Out" button when authenticated, or "Log In" / "Sign Up" buttons when not.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-08
### Added
- **Persistent Sidebar Navigation**: Implemented a modern, collapsible sidebar that remains visible on all pages on desktop screens.

### Added
